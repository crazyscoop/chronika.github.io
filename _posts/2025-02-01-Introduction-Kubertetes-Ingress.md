description: "In Kubernetes, getting external users to reach your services efficiently is key to running modern applications. One of the original ways to handle this is through the Ingress APIs. In this post, weâ€™ll break down what Kubernetes Ingress is, explain how the Ingress APIs work, and highlight the benefits and limitations of this original approach."

- [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.32/#ingress-v1-networking-k8s-io) exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.
- It acts like a smart door manager that decides which request goes to which application based on factors like the URL's host name or path.

## Core Principles of Kubernetes Ingress
### Basic Architecture
At it heart, Kubernetes Ingress consists of two parts:
- **Ingress Resource**: This is a set of rules that define how to route external requests to your service.
- **Ingress Controller**: This is the software that reads the rules defined in the Ingress resource and actually directs the traffic accordingly.

#### Ingress Resource
- The Ingress resource is defined in a YAML file. This file includes rules that map incoming traffic (by host and URL path) to specific backend services running in your cluster.
- You might set up rules that send requests for www.example.com/api to one service and www.example.com/web to another. These rules tell Kubernetes how to direct the traffic.
- A minimal Ingress Resource example:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: minimal-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx-example
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /testpath
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: test
            port:
              number: 80
```

#### Ingress Controller
- An Ingress controller is a program that reads the rules defined in your Ingress resources. It then configures a **load balancer** to make sure the traffic is sent to the right services.
- For example with [ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/), the controller **automatically** creates a single load balancer (with one public IP) that serves all the Ingress resources it manages.
- However, other implementations or configurations can vary. For instance, cloud-specific controllers may allow you to configure individual load balancers per Ingress resource, depending on your architecture or security requirements.
- A [comprehensive list](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/#additional-controllers) of Ingress controllers.
- A [comparison](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/191WWNpjJ2za6-nbG4ZoUMXMpUK8KlCIosvQB0f-oq3k/edit?gid=907731238#gid=907731238) of various Ingress Controllers.

## Types of Ingress

### Ingress backed by a single Service
The ingress is serving a single service inside cluster.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
 subgraph cluster["cluster"]
        ingress["Ingress, 178.91.123.132"]
        pod1["Pod"]
        service1["Service service:4200"]
        pod2["Pod"]
  end
    client(["client"]) -. "Ingress-managed <br> load balancer" .-> ingress
    ingress -- /foo --> service1
    service1 --> pod1 & pod2

     ingress:::k8s
     pod1:::k8s
     service1:::k8s
     pod2:::k8s
     client:::plain
    classDef plain fill:#ddd,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:4px,color:#000
    classDef k8s fill:#326ce5,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:4px,color:#fff
    classDef cluster fill:#fff,stroke:#bbb,stroke-width:2px,color:#326ce5
```

- The client initiates a request that first reaches an ingress-managed load balancer. This load balancer is responsible for receiving external traffic and directing it into the cluster.
- The request enters the cluster through the Ingress.
- The Ingress is configured with rules, in this case a rule that matches request with the path `/foo`.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: "example.com"
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /foo
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: test    
            port:
              number: 4200  
```
- This can also be achieved with an ingress by specifying a default backend with no rules.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test-ingress
spec:
  defaultBackend:
    service:
      name: test
      port:
        number: 4200
```

### Simple Fanout

A Fanout configuration routes traffic from a single IP address to more than one Service, based on the HTTP URI being requested. An Ingress allows you to keep the number of load balancers down to a minimum.

```mermaid
graph LR;
  client([client])-. Ingress-managed <br> load balancer .->ingress[Ingress, 178.91.123.132];
  ingress-->|/foo|service1[Service service1:4200];
  ingress-->|/bar|service2[Service service2:8080];
  subgraph cluster
  ingress;
  service1-->pod1[Pod];
  service1-->pod2[Pod];
  service2-->pod3[Pod];
  service2-->pod4[Pod];
  end
  classDef plain fill:#ddd,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:4px,color:#000;
  classDef k8s fill:#326ce5,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:4px,color:#fff;
  classDef cluster fill:#fff,stroke:#bbb,stroke-width:2px,color:#326ce5;
  class ingress,service1,service2,pod1,pod2,pod3,pod4 k8s;
  class client plain;
  class cluster cluster;
```

- The client initiates a request that first reaches an ingress-managed load balancer.
- The request enters the cluster through the Ingress.
- The Ingress is configured with rules. The rules in this case are
    - request with path `/foo` are forwarded to `service1` service.
    - request with path `/bar` are forwarded to `service2` service.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: simple-fanout-example
spec:
  rules:
  - host: foo.bar.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /foo
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: service1
            port:
              number: 4200
      - path: /bar
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: service2
            port:
              number: 8080
```

### Name based virtual hosting
Name-based virtual hosts support routing HTTP traffic to multiple host names at the same IP address.

```mermaid
graph LR;
  client([client])-. Ingress-managed <br> load balancer .->ingress[Ingress, 178.91.123.132];
  ingress-->|Host: foo.bar.com|service1[Service service1:80];
  ingress-->|Host: bar.foo.com|service2[Service service2:80];
  subgraph cluster
  ingress;
  service1-->pod1[Pod];
  service1-->pod2[Pod];
  service2-->pod3[Pod];
  service2-->pod4[Pod];
  end
  classDef plain fill:#ddd,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:4px,color:#000;
  classDef k8s fill:#326ce5,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:4px,color:#fff;
  classDef cluster fill:#fff,stroke:#bbb,stroke-width:2px,color:#326ce5;
  class ingress,service1,service2,pod1,pod2,pod3,pod4 k8s;
  class client plain;
  class cluster cluster;
```

- The client initiates a request that first reaches an ingress-managed load balancer.
- The request enters the cluster through the Ingress.
- The Ingress is configured with rules. The rules in this case are
    - request with hostname `foo.bar.com` are forwarded to `service1` service.
    - request with path `bar.foo.com` are forwarded to `service2` service.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: name-virtual-host-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: foo.bar.com
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/"
        backend:
          service:
            name: service1
            port:
              number: 80
  - host: bar.foo.com
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/"
        backend:
          service:
            name: service2
            port:
              number: 80
```

## Limitations of the Ingress API
- Ingress primarily supports TLS termination and basic, content-based HTTP routing
- Advanced routing features require non-standard, vendor-specific annotations. Every implementation has its own supported extensions that may not translate to any other implementation.
    - For example, to rewrite incoming URLs (for instance, changing `/old-path` to `/new-path`), implementations like ingress-nginx require a vendor-specific annotation such as `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /new-path`.
- The Ingress API is not well-suited for multi-team clusters with shared load-balancing infrastructure. With Ingress, tasks such as setting up and managing gateways (which are more relevant to platform engineering) are often handled by application developers.
