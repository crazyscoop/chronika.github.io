## Why do we need Cert-Manager?
- Cert-manager automates the process of issuing, renewing, and managing TLS certificates, saving you from manual certificate handling.
- It works natively within Kubernetes, automatically storing certificates as secrets and integrating with Ingress resources for secure HTTPS endpoints.
- Certificates have expiration dates. Cert-manager ensures certificates are renewed in time, reducing the risk of service interruptions due to expired certificates.
- With cert-manager, you can easily use various certificate authorities (like Let's Encrypt), ensuring your applications maintain a strong security posture with minimal effort.
